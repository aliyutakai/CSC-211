            <h4 style="font-weight: bolder;">Discription of the Event</h4>
            <p>A total of 2,380 students took the Matriculation Oath for the 2016/2017 Academic Session during the 1st Matriculation Ceremony held at the Convocation Arena, University Park, last Friday.

                Speaking at the Ceremony, Vice-Chancellor, Professor Aliyu Muhammad Falali, who congratulated the students for scaling through the rigorous selection process for admission into the University, which he said is one of the most subscribed tertiary institutions in the country, pointed out that “it is due to our well-established culture of academic excellence since the inception of the University in 1975”. He expressed hope that the students “would imbibe this widely-acknowledged tradition of academic and sporting excellence that has brought us immense recognition both at home and abroad”, adding that the significance of the Matriculation Ceremony should guide their conduct through out their stay in the Institution.
                Professor Aliyu Muhammad Falali stated that “the Matriculation Ceremony marks your formal admission as bona fide members of a specialized community of Scholars, who are united in their search for higher knowledge that would serve the greater interest of society”, adding that the event marks their formal integration into the University system that is dedicated to the advancement of the frontiers of knowledge for the benefit of mankind and self-improvement.
                “The Matriculation Oath spells out certain ethos and rules of intellectual engagement that must guide your behaviour in and outside the classroom at all times” the Vice-Chancellor told the Fresh Students, stressing that they were expected to obey the rules and regulations of the University and also exhibit a high degree of personal discipline as a precondition to success in their studies and future career.
                The Vice-Chancellor advised them “to shun unethical tendencies such as cultism and examination malpractice”, warning that Senate of the University will not hesitate to invoke relevant sections of the law against any student caught engaging in acts that are adjudged inconsistent with the terms of his or her admission into the University.</p>
